_About the project_

https://github.com/Jauhoparta/IODS-project

Getting to know R and R markdown is one of the first things I want to do as a master student of statistics. This course and the exercises should, in my view, provide a platform to try out new stuff, help others and practice writing R in real life. 

In addition, learning github is a super bonus, as I have used it previously for some downloads but never for sharing work.

**Write a short description about the course and add a link to your GitHub repository here. This is an R Markdown (.Rmd) file so you can use R Markdown syntax.**
