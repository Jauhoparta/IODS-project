# Now the data are in long form. this means that both for BPRSL (the long one) and RATSL, we have fewer variables than before.
# The variables are, for RATSL: ID, Groupl, Wo√©ight and time while for BPRSL they are treatment, subject, bprsl and week. 
# The variable weeks is redundant since we already have the same info in week.

# The long version of the data allows us to do time dependent analysis on the datasets. The short form does not support our analysis.
